Let's start with the basic definition, regex is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern that helps match, locate and search through text. Once you learn the new syntax you will be able to user regex in almost any programming language! Let's dive a bit deeper and learn some syntax!

## Summary
In this tutorial you will learn how to search threw documents by using patterns to locate text using the regex syntax.

## Regex Components
 " . " : The period operator matches any single character, for example sle.h will return aisle, isle, and  hassle.

"\ followed by a single character" : The backslash operator matches special characters as a single character, \.css$ will return any string ending in .css.

" $ " : The dollar sign operator matches any string where the pattern occurs at the end of the string. Ex. /e$/ matches apple and snapple but not apples.

" ^ " : The upward arrow matches any string where the pattern happens at the start of the string. Ex. ^apple matches apples but not snapple. 

" [] " : The bracket operator matches any one character inside the brackets, for example [abc] will return and string that a 'a', 'b', or 'c' occurs.

" | " : This operator is called the or operator. Ex apple|dog find the sting including  apple or dog.

" () " : The parenthesis are used to group expressions!
